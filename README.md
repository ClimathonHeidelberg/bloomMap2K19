## SpringUp - Providing you with action against climate change

We motivate you, the individual, to "spring up" and to get involved in helping understand how climate change is happening your backyard. Our WebApp allows you to collect data of blooming trees in your neighborhood through fun challenges. The collected data allows timely decision making.

### Context

According to a 2019 press release from Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), there are currently 1088 volunteer "Beobachter" or "watchers" who collect bloom data; The method for data acquisition was only recently digitalized in 2014 but lacks a user-friendly and engaging design. The solution is not scalable, especially not internationally, where other countries may not have the infrastructure and manpower.

### Description

#### What is the main idea?

We implemented a WebApp, which allows a community-driven and internationally scalable method of collecting data for blooming trees. Our goal is to collect as many images of blooming trees as possible to provide a more detailed analysis of the effects of climate change on phenology. 

#### How does it work?

A user is challenged to take a picture of a blooming tree in their community. We predict blooming species of trees on a local level based on historical data. When the user uploads an image of a blooming tree, our Machine Learning model analyzes the picture to classify if the tree is the correct species and if it is in fact blooming. Once verified, the user is eligible for prizes (e.g. coupons, stickers in the App, etc.).

#### How are we different?

We propose to motivate and engage individuals to make a real difference in tackling climate change. Our solution is digital and user-friendly with its simple and attractive interface. With the aid of predictive analysis, we make scientific predictions on the bloom times of different species of trees and gamify the collection of blooming tree data through fun challenges. Our method of collecting data provides us with high-density data. Our method is not limited to a single community or country and is internationally scalable.

#### Who are we targeting?

Our primary target group is school classes, but our solution is fit for many groups, such as gardeners or dog owners. With the aid of state regulation (e.g. Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg), our solution could easily be included in educational programs. The introduction of climate change awareness to school children would not only foster early education and knowledge but also ensure sustainable behavior in the future.
